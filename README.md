# PHSX815 Project 2
## Rayleigh-Biased Dice Roll SImulation
### Description:
For this project, I sample from a Rayleigh distribution to determine the probabilities of each side of a die, to be used in simulation. I simulate a dice roll for 10^4 experiments, with varying numbers of rolls per experiment. I am to quanitfy the power of a log-likelihood test for any given number of rolls per experiment. 

### Parameters:
The user is able to specify the numbers of sides on the dice being used. The default is 6, but any value > 0 can be used. The user can also specify the number of experiments, and rolls per experiment. 
### Usage
All python scripts can be ran from the command line with the `-h` or `--help` flags to display all the options.
